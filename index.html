        <h3>HTML/CSS/JS</h3>
        <p>HTML and CSS I learned in University and have continued to 
           better my knowledge of each to improve my skills using them. Javascript I decided to start learning on my own,
           because a programming language such as Javascript is very powerful to use with websites. I only have a basic 
           understanding of the language but want to keep learning so I can do a lot more with development </p>

        <h3>Let's get down to Business</h3>
        <p>College and my empoyment have afforded me the opportunity to work extensively in customer service, gain management skills, learn to work efficiently while multi-tasking. Developer
          the ability to ability to work under pressure in a fast-paced environment, and handle difficult situations while interating with customers. I have gained invaluable skills through my
          employment and school; however, at this stage in my career I am ready for new challenges and a chance to work in a field that could offer great opportunities for growth
